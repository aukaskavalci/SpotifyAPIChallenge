# SpotifyAPIChallenge

As a new Golang lover and a spotify user, this API provided. It is just the beginning of the overall idea but basically it is responsible for analyzing best tracks within all playlist of specific person which is Gulsah Guray right now.

What is done
------------
1.Error Handling<br/>
2.Pagination<br/>
3.Analyzing & getting the winner tracks!<br />

About Next steps..
------------------
In the proposed usage of Spotify API, all request should pass the step of authentication by getting a valid OAuth access token.
In this API, token is obtained manually from https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlists/?user_id=gulsahguray&limit=&offset=  

As it can be understood from this point, OAuth will be applied with a UI to redirect user to Spotify for getting token, get the user name as playlists owner & show the winner tracks.


Bonus
-----
New playlist wil be created to add the winner tracks. Coolest & the most useful part is BONUS :fire:
